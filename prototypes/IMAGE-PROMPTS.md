## Negative Prompts (What to Avoid)

Use these to exclude unwanted elements:

```
blurry, low quality, 3D render, realistic photo, human, legs, arms, weapons, text, watermark, UI elements, multiple snakes, side view, perspective, shadows on ground, complex background, cluttered, pixelated, jpeg artifacts
```

**Explanation:**
- **No 3D render:** Want flat 2D sprite style
- **No realistic photo:** Want stylized cartoon
- **No human/legs/arms:** Pure snake character
- **No text/watermark:** Clean asset
- **No multiple snakes:** Single character reference
- **No side view:** Top-down only
- **No perspective:** Orthographic flat view
- **No complex background:** Focus on character

---

## Image Generator Settings Recommendations

### Midjourney
```
/imagine [prompt] --ar 1:1 --style raw --v 6 --q 2
```
- `--ar 1:1`: Square aspect ratio for game asset
- `--style raw`: Less stylized, cleaner
- `--v 6`: Latest version
- `--q 2`: High quality

**Example:**
```
/imagine Top-down snake character, solid sky blue color, smooth gradient, white eyes, simple clean design, gaming asset, dark navy background, vector style --ar 1:1 --style raw --v 6 --q 2
```

### DALL-E 3
- Use natural language descriptions
- Emphasize "top-down view" and "game asset"
- Request "high resolution" and "clean vector style"

**Example:**
```
Create a top-down view of a cartoon snake character for a video game. The snake should be sky blue with smooth gradient shading, large white eyes with black pupils, and a simple clean design. Style it as a vector art game asset on a dark navy background. High resolution, clean and professional.
```

### Stable Diffusion (with ControlNet)
**Prompt:**
```
(top-down view:1.3), (snake character:1.2), [skin-specific details], game asset, vector art, clean design, dark background, (high quality:1.2), (detailed:1.1)
```

**Negative:**
```
(blurry:1.2), (3D:1.1), realistic, photo, human, text, watermark, low quality, side view, perspective
```

**Settings:**
- Steps: 30-50
- CFG Scale: 7-9
- Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler A
- Resolution: 1024x1024

## Reference Images (Optional)

If your AI tool supports reference images, describe these existing games:

**Style References:**
1. **Slither.io** - Classic .io game snake, simple circular segments, top-down
2. **Agar.io** - Circular cell design, simple gradients
3. **Diep.io** - Geometric shapes, neon colors on dark background
4. **Surviv.io** - Top-down game assets, clean vector style

**Visual Mood Board:**
- Esports team logos (neon colors, bold designs)
- Tron aesthetic (glowing neon lines, dark background)
- Cyberpunk UI (vibrant accents, tech patterns)
- Competitive gaming overlays (bold typography, high contrast)

---

## Batch Generation Strategy

### Round 1: Base Designs (3 variations each)
Generate 3 variations of each skin to compare:
1. **Variation A:** Exact prompt as written
2. **Variation B:** Add "vibrant" and increase glow emphasis
3. **Variation C:** Add "minimalist" and reduce effects

**Pick best from each set**

### Round 2: Refinements
Take the best variation from Round 1 and refine:
- Adjust colors (if too bright/dark)
- Enhance patterns (if too subtle)
- Add/remove glow (if too much/little)

### Round 3: Final Assets
Generate final high-resolution versions with:
- Transparent background (PNG format)
- Multiple angles if needed (head, body, tail closeups)
- Color variations for A/B testing

---

## Expected Deliverables

For each skin, generate:

1. **Main Character Sprite** (1024x1024px)
   - Top-down full snake view
   - Transparent background
   - High resolution PNG

2. **Head Closeup** (512x512px)
   - Focus on eyes and head segment
   - For skin selector preview

3. **Segment Pattern** (256x256px)
   - Tileable body segment texture
   - For applying to multiple segments

4. **Icon/Thumbnail** (128x128px)
   - Small preview for UI
   - Skin gallery display

## Tips for Best Results

### Do's
✅ Start with simple prompts, add detail gradually
✅ Generate multiple variations, pick best
✅ Use "game asset" and "sprite" keywords
✅ Emphasize "top-down view" clearly
✅ Request "transparent background" or "alpha channel"
✅ Include "vector style" for clean edges
✅ Use color hex codes if tool supports it

### Don'ts
❌ Don't add "snake in grass" or environmental context
❌ Don't request "realistic scales" (want stylized)
❌ Don't forget to specify "top-down" (AI defaults to side view)
❌ Don't ask for "animation" (want static sprite)
❌ Don't include multiple snakes in one image
❌ Don't add complex backgrounds (want dark/transparent)

## Post-Generation Checklist

After generating images, verify:

- [ ] **Top-down view** (not side or 3D perspective)
- [ ] **Transparent or dark background** (no grass, no complex scenes)
- [ ] **Clean edges** (vector-style, not pixelated)
- [ ] **Correct colors** (match hex codes from SKIN-DESIGNS.md)
- [ ] **Pattern visible** (stripes, scales, flames, etc. clearly shown)
- [ ] **Eyes prominent** (large, expressive, correct color)
- [ ] **Glow effects** (for premium skins, outer aura visible)
- [ ] **High resolution** (1024x1024 minimum, suitable for game use)
- [ ] **Single snake** (not multiple, not with background objects)
- [ ] **Consistent style** (matches other skins, cohesive set)

## Example Workflow

1. **Start with Classic Blue** (simplest design)
   - Generate 3 variations with basic prompt
   - Pick best, note what works

2. **Generate all Free Skins** (Blue, Green, Orange)
   - Use similar prompt structure
   - Ensure consistent style between them

3. **Generate Premium Skins** (Purple, Viper, Fury)
   - Add glow effects to prompts
   - Increase detail level

4. **Generate Premium+ Skins** (Gold, Cyber, Inferno, Phantom)
   - Maximum detail and effects
   - Ensure they feel "premium" compared to free

5. **Review Full Set**
   - Check visual hierarchy (free → premium → premium+)
   - Ensure all skins distinct from each other
   - Verify colorblind accessibility (pattern differences)

6. **Generate Supporting Assets**
   - Icons (128x128)
   - Closeups (512x512)
   - Segment textures (256x256)
